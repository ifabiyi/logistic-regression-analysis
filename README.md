# logistic-regression-analysis
  Logistic Regression Project - In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, 
  indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement on a company website. 
  We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
  
  Also we will work with Titanic Data Set from Kaggle. 
  This is a very famous data set and very often is a student's first step in machine learning!
  We'll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased. Let's begin our understanding of implementing Logistic Regression in Python for classification.
  We'll use a "semi-cleaned" version of the titanic data set, if you use the data set hosted directly on Kaggle, you may need to do some additional cleaning not shown in this lecture notebook.
